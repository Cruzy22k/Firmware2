To use this switch to VT2, Enter chronos by typing `chronos` Make sure you use **CHRONOS** and not **ROOT**
Then type this command. 
Don't worry if it gives you a warning about noexec mount, this is intended behaviour 

`cd; curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cruzy22k/NissaFW2/main/firmware.sh && chmod +x firmware.sh && bash firmware.sh`

Follow the prompts, ensuring you have firmware and hardware **WP** **DISABLED** as this will not work with WP ON.
